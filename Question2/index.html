                    <h2>Question2</h2>
                    <p>If you are given Windows 10 as your work machine (with 8-core CPUs and 16GB RAM), 
                       but you need to work with many Pythons and Linux Bash scripting along with many 
                       different Linux based docker containers.</p>
                    <p>Assuming you cannot change the machineâ€™s operating system and cannot re-partition any of the local HDDs; 
                       However, you have admin access to install software and enabling some Windows features.</p>
                    <p>How would you setup your work environment on the machine?</p>

                    SOEs exist for a reason, whether it be security or maintainability,
                    learning to co-exist with the soe is not that onerous (usually) and
                    there are ways around most issues as outlined.
